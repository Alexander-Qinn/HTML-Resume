    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        I am a very active member of the USA fencing community who grew up in Princeton Junction New Jersey. 
        I've been coding since I graduated high school seeking to get into the Software Engineering Field.
        Currently I am working on Game Design, as well as learning as many tools as required to be an active 
        and effective full stack engineer.
