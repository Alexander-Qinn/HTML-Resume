    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Stock BackTester Program (Summer 2023)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Coded a program that would allow an input of a formula for some Alpha value, and then using that alpha value automatically trade
            stocks and update a basic PNL graph calculating financial indicators such as Net Income, and Sharpe Ratio</li>
        <li>Allows for multi-graphing for comparing baseline and other Alpha values</li>
        <li>Utilizes Pandas DataFrames to pull and calculate financial values, and then records all monthly increases or decreases</li>
        <li>Created WebScraper to pull Indicator Data from a sellers website</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Memory Map Reader (Summer 2023)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Worked with supervisor 欧阳俊 to develop an algorithm to increase data reading speed in comparison to the standard pandas
            read_pickle() function.</li>
        <li>Reads files at Linear time, and is coded for multiple data type aliases</li>
        <li>Saves read data into different data types, automatically converting them</li>
        <li>Has functions Update, Upsert, Read, and Save coded and implemented</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Neural Network based Portfolio Optimizer (Summer 2023)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Researched and implemented a Neural Network to Optimize Portfolio based off Sharpe Ratio within a subset of stock tickers. 3
            Linear Layers and one LSTM Layer</li>
        <li>Utilizes PyTorch and Markowitz equation as the objective Function to move Forward</li>
        <li>Uses Reverse Sharpe Ratio as the Loss function</li>
        <li>Chooses the best 20 stocks or n stocks of a subset, using general Adam Optimizer function, and then returning a list of stocks</li>
        <li>Uses a Portfolio approach and linear approximation method to move the portfolio through the Hidden Layers, Pseudo Implicit
            Layers, Allocations, then finally the Loss Function.</li>
    </ul>
